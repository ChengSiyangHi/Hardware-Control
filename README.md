# HardwareControl
Matlab code for controlling hardware equipments in a optics lab. Specifically for piezo stages from Mad City Labs and sCOMS cameras from Photometrics.

## Calibrarion code V1: 
The piezo stage stops at each Z position, and the camera aquires data continuously.

## Calibrarion code V2: 
The piezo stage stops at each Z position, and the camera take certain frames according to the DAQ boarding triggering.

## Calibrarion code V3: 
The piezo stage stops at each Z position, and the camera take certain frames according to the DAQ boarding triggering.
A csv file is generated and saved for EasyDHPSF calibrations.
